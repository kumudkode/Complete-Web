Please create an HTML page with a Spider-Man themed design (red and blue color scheme) for an educational/tutorial website. Include:

1. Responsive navigation bar with spider icon
2. Header with gradient background
3. Content sections with:
    - Icon headers
    - Code examples in formatted blocks
    - Interactive demos
    - Spider-web styled bullet points
4. Animation effects (web-swing, hover transitions)
5. Styled footer with social links
6. Back-to-top button functionality

Use the same styling approach with CSS variables, section borders, card-like content blocks, web pattern backgrounds, and transitions as in the Spider-Code tutorial page.
