//memory is a crucial aspect of programming, as it determines how data is stored and accessed in a program.
// Stack, heap and memory management are important concepts in programming that help manage memory efficiently and effectively.
// Stack memory is used for static memory allocation, while heap memory is used for dynamic memory allocation.
// Stack memory is faster than heap memory, but has limited size and is used for storing local variables and function calls.
// Heap memory is slower than stack memory, but has larger size and is used for storing objects and data structures.
// Memory management is the process of allocating and deallocating memory in a program to optimize performance and prevent memory leaks.
// It involves techniques such as garbage collection, reference counting, and memory pooling to manage memory efficiently and effectively.
// Creating visual representations of stack and heap memory
