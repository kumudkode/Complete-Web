ðŸ§© Just Launched: Interactive Maze Runner with Algorithm Visualization
I'm excited to share a project I've been working on - an interactive Maze Runner built with vanilla JavaScript, CSS, and HTML!

Key Features:

Dynamic maze generation using recursive backtracking
Visual A* pathfinding algorithm with real-time tracking
Interactive keyboard navigation
Light/dark mode with smooth transitions
Dynamic lighting effects that follow cursor movement
Particle animations and trail effects
Fully responsive design
This project was a great opportunity to dive deep into algorithmic visualization while creating an engaging UI experience. No frameworks or libraries were used - just pure web technologies demonstrating what's possible with modern CSS and JavaScript!

Check out the live demo (link in comments) and let me know what you think! Interested in how it works? I've written a detailed breakdown on Medium.
